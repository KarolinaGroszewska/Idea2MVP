## Vocabulary
- **MVP** (or minimum viable product) refers to the idea of creating a project that is focused on adding the least amount of features possible while still making a usable app that follows our vision. MVPs do not need to sacrifice the "heart" of our product â€“ but they should focus on one core user, one core need, and one core feature.
- **MoSCoW** method refers to the following acronym for determining features of your MVP projects
  - Must Have (M): critical, non-negotiable (app cannot exist without this feature)
  - Should Have (S): greatly improve the user experience, but are not required for the app to function. These are the first features developed after the MVP is completed.
  - Could Have (C): nice to have, but not critical. Should be considered for future releases.
  - Won't Have (W): not a priority for the MVP, either not included at all or to be included in a future released.
